        <p><strong>Warning: This exhibit features content related to death, disease, and violence, including involving children and enslaved persons. Minors and individuals sensitive to these topics should proceed with discretion.</strong></p>
		<p>The map to the right features information about over 1,400 individuals who passed away in the City of Charleston in the year 1860. We'd like you, their modern-day neighbors, to meet them.</p>
		<p>The year 1860 is featured because it a precipice for the history of the country and of Charleston. Two years earlier a yellow fever epidemic swept through the city, which physicians and other citizens were still grappling with along with the other diseases and perils constant to 19th-century life. By the end of the year South Carolina would no longer consider itself a part of the United States, and as the first state to secede and the future site of the first battle of the Civil War, Charlestonians were as keenly aware as anyone of the ramifications of national politics. And yet still the constants of everyday life carried on, including the "great equalizer" of death. </p>
		<p>Besides the basic data of name, date, and cause of death, city health officials recorded what they considered to be the most important information about each person, including burial place, gender, race, enslavement status and name of enslaver, age, occupation, birthplace, street where they lived, and the name of their physician. We've included all the data given and presented it in a way that allows you to see trends and correlations and ask new questions about life in Charleston during this time.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more than any time since 1860, right now we know what it's like to see Charleston in the midst of disease and unrest. And like our counterparts of 160 years ago, we continue to love and grieve and carry on. Maybe on the street where you grew up or around the corner from your favorite restaurant, people just like you lived and died and were a part of the ongoing story of the city. We hope you'll be able to see something of yourself in them, and see yourself as a part of that story too.</p>

For larger points representing multiple people, click "Browse Features" and then use the left and right arrows at the top of the popup to scroll through each person. Please note that terms used correspond to information given in the records and some, like "mulatto," may not be appropriate for modern use.</p>
          <p>The map that overlays the peninsula is from 1855, please see "Sources" for more information.</p>
          <p>The green shapes are burial places listed in the records. Click on them for more information and to scroll through individuals interred there.</p>
          <div style="background: #210F04; height:40px; width:40px; border-radius:10px; padding:8px; margin: 10px 0px"><img title="Filter" alt="Filter" src="https://learn-students.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/widgets/Filter/images/icon.png?wab_dv=2.18" width="25" height="25"></div>
        <p><b>Filter:</b> You can filter points on the map based on categories of your choosing, or use one of the preset options. Filters that you set are compoundable, so for example you can show just women, just white people, or just white women. For most categories you can also select more than one attribute, for example only showing people buried at Magnolia Cemetery or the Public Cemetery. Preset filters correspond to information given in the tabs below. The filter is defaulted to off, so be sure to toggle it on after choosing your criteria to see the results.</p>
        <div style="background: #210F04; height:40px; width:40px; border-radius:10px; padding:8px; margin: 10px 0px"><img title="Time Slider" alt="Time Slider" src="https://learn-students.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/widgets/TimeSlider/images/icon.png?wab_dv=2.18" width="25" height="25"></div>
        <p><b>Time Slider:</b> This shows a progressive time lapse of deaths throughout the year. This can be used in conjunction with filters, for example with a specific disease to show its spread across the city over time.</p>
        <div style="background: #210F04; height:40px; width:40px; border-radius:10px; padding:8px; margin: 10px 0px"><img title="Legend" alt="Legend" src="https://learn-students.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/widgets/Legend/images/icon.png?wab_dv=2.18" width="25" height="25"></div>
        <p><b>Legend:</b> The colors of the data points represent the race of the person in the record, while the size of the point reflects the number of records for that location. As the records only record the street on which the person lived, not the exact house number, individuals living on the same street overlap and require a visual representation to show more than one person. This means that the exact location where each person lived will be more accurate on shorter streets like Henrietta Street, and less so on longer ones like King Street. Only a handful of records correspond to a precise location, like Roper Hospital or the Alms House. Grey indicates a group of people on the same street with no race in the majority. If you zoom in or out, the size of the clusters and the number of points clustered together will adjust. </p>
        <div style="background: #210F04; height:40px; width:40px; border-radius:10px; padding:8px; margin: 10px 0px"><img title="Layers" alt="Layers" src="https://learngis2.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/widgets/LayerList/images/icon.png?wab_dv=2.18" width="25" height="25"></div>
        <p><b>Layers:</b> Select this to toggle different layers on and off. For example, to see burial places without the data points, uncheck "Deaths 1860."</p>
        <div style="background: #210F04; height:40px; width:40px; border-radius:10px; padding:8px; margin: 10px 0px"><img title="Swipe" alt="Swipe" src="https://learngis2.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappbuilder/stemapp/widgets/Swipe/images/icon.png?wab_dv=2.18" width="25" height="25"></div>
        <p><b>Swipe:</b> Select this to easily compare modern locations with historic ones. Move the line across the screen and the 1855 map's visibility will change.</p>

    <p>What kind of city were these individuals living in the year they died? The federal government undertook a nationwide census in 1860, and the city of Charleston conducted its own local census in 1861, which gives us the information provided in Figures 1 through 3.<sup>1</sup> The United States, South Carolina, and Charleston all feature what demographers call “Expansive Population Pyramids,” which suggest a high birth rate, high population growth, and low life expectancies typical of a less economically developed areas.<sup>2</sup> By comparing Charleston to the greater US, we can see a city that is particularly diverse, with white people making up slightly more than half the population. However South Carolina in general was around 40% white, most likely due to the large slaveholding plantations located in rural areas outside of the city.</p>
<p>With these racial divisions and intersections came a variety of attitudes about the coming war. Many enslaved people in urban Charleston became more open in their disregard for white oppression, much to the chagrin of disgruntled slaveholders.<sup>3</sup> For white male leaders, April brought the National Democratic Convention to Charleston to nominate Lincoln’s opponent, Stephen Douglas, and to argue about the place of slavery within an increasingly divided party.<sup>4</sup> Eight months later, as the Ordinance of Secession was signed and shared throughout the city, the “fire-eaters” who valued slavery over union erupted into enthusiastic celebration, while the less-devoted secessionists, including the diarist Mary Boykin Chestnut, grew more anxious about the coming violence.<sup>5</sup> Free people of color, meanwhile, were caught between racial and familial ties to the enslaved, their status as free persons, and suspicions of disloyalty by white neighbors.<sup>6</sup> This racial element was even more complicated for the high number of free persons who were mixed race.<sup>7</sup> Concerned about their fate in the coming upheaval, many threw their lot in with the secessionists to protect themselves and their social standing.<sup>8</sup>
</p>
<p>Charleston was on a precipice by the end of the year, only four months away from the first shots on Fort Sumter. But for now, in 1860, the cannons are silent still, haven’t yet vocalized the anxiety of a nation. City inhabitants go about their business as always, and the rising tensions do nothing to stop the routine of life and of death. It is the last moments of a world that will never truly exist again.</p>

     <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-6 col-sm-11">
    <p>Given here are a few details about a handful of individuals mapped from the Return of Death records. Together they represent a small sample of the spectrum of Charleston society, enslaved, free, male, female, young, and old.</p><div style="padding:0vw 3vw">
    <h4>Charles Fraser</h4>
        <p>A Charleston native and lawyer, Charles Fraser would ultimately become best known as a painter of miniature portraits, and to a lesser extent landscapes and illustrations for travel guides.<sup>1</sup> He spoke at the dedication ceremony for the opening of Magnolia Cemetery in 1850, discussing the health and sanitation benefits of burial outside of urban areas.<sup>2</sup> When he passed away at the age of 78 in October 1860, he was buried at St. Michael’s Church in the heart of downtown Charleston.<sup>3</sup> His works can be seen in art collections throughout the country, and many can be seen locally at the <a style="color:#675226" href="https://www.gibbesmuseum.org/miniatures/fraser-book/">Gibbes Museum.</a></p>
    <h4>Charles, Abel, Levy, Clara, and Margaret - Slaves of West Point Mill</h4>
    <p>As a result of financial difficulties, in March 1860 the Lucas family of Charleston was forced to sell the West Point Rice Mill to a group of investors.<sup>4</sup> Built along the Ashley River by Jonathan Lucas III in 1840, and once producing up to 40% of Charleston’s rice, it burned to the ground in November 1860, eight months after its sale.<sup>5</sup> Five entries in the Return of Death records list the West Point Mills Association as an enslaver, all with dates from April 30 to October 25 of 1860.<sup>6</sup> The two girls, Clara and Margaret, were one year old children, while Charles, Abel, and Levy were laborers aged 35, 19, and 18, respectively.<sup>7</sup> As the new owners sold off two male slaves aged 45 and 55 immediately after purchasing the mill, it’s possible that these men and others enslaved with them were retained for their relative youth and ability to work.<sup>8</sup> The advertisement posted for the mill in late 1859 lists as one of its assets “The accommodation for the operatives consist[ing] of 15 Houses, the majority of them having been lately put up. These afford sufficient room for the hands working the establishment.”<sup>9</sup> The presence of Clara and Margaret suggests that these did not only house workers enslaved for milling rice and its associated tasks, but also mothers and children. How these people were affected and where they lived after the mill’s burning is unclear, but the West Point Rice Mill continued in operation until 1912 so it is likely they returned and continued to be enslaved there until emancipation in 1863.<sup>10</sup></p>
    <h4>Ellen Hampton</h4>
    <p>Ellen, a 25 year old mantua (dress) maker, passed away of consumption in May 1860.<sup>11</sup> She was a free woman of color who lived on what is now Kirkland Lane with her brother Benjamin, mother Daphne, and Benjamin’s wife Sarah.<sup>12</sup> Like Ellen, Benjamin and Sarah were involved in the garment industry, with Benjamin employed as a tailor and Sarah a milliner.<sup>13</sup> The family had this in common with many of Charleston’s other “brown aristocrats,” or wealthy free people of color, who were often skilled laborers and craftsmen living in urban areas.<sup>14</sup> Ellen was engaged to Edward White, a carpenter living on the same street who had previously lost a wife in childbirth.<sup>15</sup> Two days after her death a neighbor wrote that Edward was “much affected.”<sup>16</sup> She is buried in the Brown Fellowship Association Cemetery.<sup>17</sup></p></div>
    <p>So why, among all the heightened drama taking place in Charleston during this time, do we care about the people listed here? These individuals represent only a few for whom enough information could be found to describe their lives in just slightly more detail. For many, if not most, we know very little about them besides the data reported in the city’s Return of Death records. Many of their headstones are gone or worn smooth by now, the names of their friends and spouses, parents and children perhaps forgotten. Their family alive today, if they have any, may still be in Charleston or scattered throughout the country or the world. Probably few of their descendants ever think of them. Do you know the names of your ancestors who lived or died 160 years ago?</p>
    <p>In short, we care because their lives were very ordinary, their deaths sadly common for their time. We care about them because they were part of a whole, in the same way that you or anyone else makes up a part of a community as they deal with the routines and constants of life in a historic time of disease and unrest. Perhaps a Charlestonian in 1860 may have found that situation relatable.</p>

     <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-6 col-sm-11">
    <p>Urban dwellers of the early- to mid-nineteenth century, encouraged by the need for space in newly-industrial city centers, as well as the fear of contagion from the dead, began participating in the “rural cemetery movement.”<sup>1</sup> Instead of the cloistered church graveyards popular up to this point, rural cemeteries located outside of town limits catered to a new visual preference: rolling hills, open fields, trees balefully arching over creeks and tranquil lakes. Sweeping disease outbreaks of the 1850s, including Charleston’s 1858 yellow fever epidemic, highlighted the push by cities to enforce burial outside of population centers.<sup>2</sup> Of the 1401 death record entries that contain burial place information, around 497, or 35%, were in rural burial grounds like Magnolia Cemetery or St. Lawrence Cemetery.<sup>3</sup></p>
    <p>By far the most popular single burial place was the Potter’s Field, also known as the Public Cemetery, with 212 or 15% of listed burials.<sup>4</sup> In 1860 most people interred there were black, male, and an average of 26 years old (or 42 excluding those listed as “minors”).<sup>5</sup> A place for “Charleston indigents, both black and white,” it was used until 1927 and currently rests under part of the Johnson Hagood Stadium.<sup>6</sup></p>
    <p>The locations of the burial places as plotted on this map are derived from <i>The Silence of the Dead: Giving Charleston Cemeteries A Voice</i>, a result of the extensive work of the Chicora Foundation. Many no longer exist today, victims of time and urban sprawl. Because the names of  several of these burial grounds could refer to different locations, such as the ever popular “First Baptist Church,” or a single location could go by a number of different names, the locations they have been placed on the above map is based on best guess, and generally reflects the distributions of interments as far as existing information allows.<sup>32</sup></p>

    <p>Even without the looming war, the mid-nineteenth century was a tumultuous time in which to live. Inhabitants of Charleston and the South as a whole, with its warm humidity and accompanying mosquitos, were particularly vulnerable to tropical diseases like dysentery, typhoid, malaria, and yellow fever, along with the usual range of infection like smallpox and tuberculosis common in this time.<sup>1</sup> The Charleston medical community was particularly preoccupied with yellow fever, which had killed around six hundred people in an 1854 outbreak and another seven hundred in 1858.<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>The spread and deadliness of this disease and other infections were not helped by the state of medical knowledge, which still depended on the miasma theory that bad smells spread illness. In regards to yellow fever, the City Council concluded in 1859 that “The noxious emanations of hundreds of cow-yards [as well as privy vaults, burial places, sewers, and drains,] on a hot summer’s morning, which taint the surrounding atmosphere, must be prejudicial to health.”<sup>3</sup> Professional medical care was often a luxury of the white and wealthy, though some methods (a result of often inconsistent or incomplete medical education) could involve bloodletting, leeches, induced vomiting, or medications ranging from horseradish to mercury to opium.<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p>Listed below are the top ten causes of death given in the 1860 Return of Death records. To give some perspective, Charleston County had only six cases of tuberculosis in 2019, a testament to advances in medical knowledge and treatment access.<sup>5</sup> Descriptions of these diseases and others listed in the records can be found <a style="color:#675226" href="https://tulpehockenroots.org/diseases/">here.</a><sup>6</sup></p>

    <p>Although medicine has thankfully moved beyond opium for the common cold, some responses to the diseases of the 1800s will stand out to a 2020 audience. “The epidemic Yellow Fever,” reads an 1859 Charleston City Council report, “which is supposed by a respectable part of the citizens of Charleston can be prevented by Quarantine Laws; while, on the other hand, a large and intelligent portion are of opinion that this fatal enemy to the health, trade, and commerce of the city, is of local origin—dependent upon local causes—and can only be prevented or modified by the most rigid sanitary regulations of the municipal authority.”<sup>1</sup> A commentator in April 2020 echoed this uncertainty over the value of quarantine, saying ”Why ruin our lives to keep us safe?… Give me a three-day virus, I'm totally cool with that, just don't ruin my life to do it.”<sup>2</sup> One hopes she at least adheres to “the most rigid sanitary regulations.”</p>
    <p>There also existed a familiar difference between the effect of illness on white and black bodies. Treatment of African Americans by predominantly white doctors was hindered by preconceptions that enslaved people were both prone to faking illness to avoid work and naturally immune or resistant to many common tropical diseases.<sup>3</sup> Of all deaths nationally in 1860, white deaths numbered 1.21 per 100 people, free people of color 1.27 per 100, and enslaved persons 1.76 per 100.<sup>4</sup> In Charleston the situation was even more dire, with deaths at 2.67 per 100 white people, 3.94 per 100 free people of color, and 3.44 per 100 enslaved persons.<sup>5</sup> The 1860 census report explains, “The less mortality among whites is evidently connected with their more affluent circumstances, including the command of the highest medical skill and the requisite care and attendance in sickness.”<sup>6</sup> </p>
    <p>Meanwhile in the present, cases of COVID-19 among Black Americans is 2.6 times that of white persons, with hospitalizations at 4.7 times and deaths 2.1 times the rate of white Americans.<sup>7</sup> The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) attributes this to causes similar to those given in the 1860 census report, including “socioeconomic status, access to health care, and increased exposure to the virus due to occupation (e.g., frontline, essential, and critical infrastructure workers).”<sup>8</sup> Clearly there is a barrier to health and wellbeing that was not solved by emancipation, and one that is more prominent than ever for those once again living in dangerous and disunifying times. </p>
    <p>Charlestonians have always been forced to continue our daily lives while tumultuous history unfolds. Under British occupation of the city we cooked our meals, as South Carolina seceded from the Union we went to work, and as COVID-19 ravages our community we mourn our losses as always. In many ways we have grown and improved and in many ways we have not, but as always we are responsible to each other to carry on, to learn from our past, and to remember.</p>
